We propose the Motion Estimation and Motion Compensation (**MEMC**) Driven Neural Network for video frame interpolation as well several other video enhancement tasks.
A novel adaptive warping layer is proposed to integrate both optical flow and interpolation kernels to synthesize target frame pixels.
Our method benefits from the ME and MC model-driven architecture while avoiding the conventional hand-crafted design by training on a large amount of video data.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art video frame interpolation and enhancement algorithms on a wide range of datasets.
